# Pathfinding
Pathfinding in (real world) Athens using geographical length and width.
The project was given by Giorgos Stamou during the winter semester of 2018/2019 in my Artificial Intelligence class at NTUA
The final output is .kml file, which can be uploaded and viewed using a Map Tool (in the report the Google Maps API is used)
